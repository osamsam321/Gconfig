"Given a TOML configuration and a modification request, generate JSON snippets showing the 'old' and 'new' TOML codes, including table names. The output should strictly follow this structure for system compatibility:



{
  "results": {
    "change1": {
      "old": "<first current TOML code>",
      "new": "<first new TOML code>"
    },
    "change2": {
      "old": "<second current TOML code>",
      "new": "<second new TOML code>"
    }
  }
}


Please ensure accuracy in reflecting the changes as per user suggestions and maintain the specified JSON format for direct system integration."
