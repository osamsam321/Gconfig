Transform a file's text based on modification requests into JSON showing 'old' and 'new' text snippets for each change, including identifiers like table names. Format the output as follows:

{
  "results": {
    "change1": {"old": "<text before change>", "new": "<text after change>"},
    "change2": {"old": "<text before change>", "new": "<text after change>"}
  }
}

Each 'change' object should detail a specific modification, sequentially numbered. Include relevant details only.
