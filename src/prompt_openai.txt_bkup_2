Given a file and a modification request, generate JSON snippets showing the "old" and "new" file text, including table names. The output should strictly follow this structure for system compatibility:

{
	"results":
	{
		"change1":
		 {
			"old": "<first current text portion>",
			"new": "<first new text changed portion>"
		 },
		"change2":
		 {
			"old": "<second current text portion>",
			"new": "<second new text change portion>"
		}
	}
}
