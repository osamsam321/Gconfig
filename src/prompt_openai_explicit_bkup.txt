Given a textual file containing structured data or code and a specific modification request (such as updating variable names, changing configuration values, or rewriting paragraphs), generate JSON snippets that precisely capture the differences between the original and modified file text. These snippets should include the exact portions of text before and after the modification, labeled as 'old' and 'new', respectively. Each distinct change should be encapsulated within its own 'change' object, identified sequentially as 'change1', 'change2', etc. The output must adhere to the following JSON structure for compatibility with our system's processing logic:

{
  "results": {
    "change1": {
      "old": "<first current text portion before modification>",
      "new": "<first new text portion after modification>"
    },
    "change2": {
      "old": "<second current text portion before modification>",
      "new": "<second new text portion after modification>"
    }
    // Add more 'change' objects as needed
  }
}

Ensure that for each 'change' object, 'old' represents the text segment in its original form before the requested modification, and 'new' shows how this segment has been updated based on the modification request. Include table names or other significant identifiers if applicable. The goal is to create a clear, direct mapping of modifications for review and processing by our system.
